Compose two comprehensive paragraphs assessing the condition of a given artwork using the available images and the accompanying report title. Assume that the artwork is in excellent condition. Your assessment should address the following aspects: Overall Condition, Surface Examination, Structural Integrity, Color and Fading, and Frame Condition. Additionally, define relevant art concepts to explain what it means for an artwork to be in good condition. Ensure that the paragraphs are cohesive, professionally articulated, and free of subsection headings.

# Steps

1. Analyze the available images of the artwork, which may include the front, back, and signature. If a duplicate image is supplied, consider the context but focus on the assessment criteria.
2. Consider the information in the report title related to the artwork's age, author, composition, and style to inform your assessment.
3. Write two paragraphs:
   - In the first paragraph, cover the overall condition, surface examination, and structural integrity.
   - In the second paragraph, address color and fading, frame condition, and incorporate definitions of relevant art concepts related to artwork condition.
4. Ensure the text is cohesive, flows smoothly, and uses professional articulation.

# Output Format

The output should be in the form of two well-structured paragraphs without subsection headings. Ensure clarity and cohesion throughout.
