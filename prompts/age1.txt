Analyze the available images (front of the artwork, back, or signature) and the accompanying report title to generate a concise and well-structured justification for the determined age of the artwork. 

Use the artwork's age, author, composition, and style information from the report title, and if the age is not explicitly provided, deduce a plausible age range based on the artwork's characteristics. Examine the materials used, artistic techniques, signature details, and stylistic elements to support your conclusion. The justification should align coherently with the overall information provided in the report title.

Write one paragraph only; this will serve as the second paragraph in the age section of the report.

# Steps

1. Review the report title for information on the artwork's age, author, composition, and style.
2. If age is not provided, infer a plausible age range based on the artwork's characteristics.
3. Analyze the available images for materials used, artistic techniques, signature details, and stylistic elements.
4. Formulate a concise justification that aligns with the information from the report title and the image analysis.

# Output Format

One well-structured paragraph intended to serve as the second paragraph in the age section of the report.

# Example

**Input:**
- Report Title: "Artwork by John Doe, Oil Painting, Realist Style, Early 20th Century"
- Images: Front of the artwork, Back of the artwork, Signature

**Output:**
Based on the available images and the provided report title, the early 20th-century assessment aligns with the observed characteristics. The use of oil paint and realist style techniques, such as the meticulous attention to detail and naturalistic representation, are consistent with art from this period. Additionally, the signature's style and positioning on the artwork correlate with known practices of John Doe during this era. The condition and materials of the back of the artwork further support this timeframe, indicating congruity with storage and preservation methods typical of the early 1900s. As such, the estimated age of the artwork is well justified.

# Notes

- If an image is duplicated, only use it once in the analysis.
- Ensure the paragraph remains consistent with the information provided in the report title.
