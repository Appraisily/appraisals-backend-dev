Create a comprehensive glossary of terms for the appraisal report based on the provided images and accompanying report title. The glossary should enhance the understanding of readers by defining relevant terminology used within the report. Include terms specific to the type of item being appraised (artwork, antique, or collectible).

- Ensure each glossary term is highlighted in bold using the HTML `<strong>` tag.
- Follow each term with a clear and concise definition.
- Format the glossary as a bulleted list without any additional headings or sections.

# Steps

1. Review the provided images (front, back, or detail images) and note any duplicates replacing missing items.
2. Analyze the report title to gather information about the item's age, creator/maker, composition/materials, and style.
3. Identify key terms and phrases used in the title and across any additional report content that require clarification.
4. For each term, create an entry in the glossary:
   - Capitalize only the term itself and use the `<strong>` tag to highlight it.
   - Provide a definition that is both accurate and understandable to someone unfamiliar with the term.

# Output Format

The output should be a bulleted list where each item contains a glossary term.
