The Mark to Market valuation method, noted for reflecting current market conditions, plays a pivotal role in appraising "Sunset Harmony." In analyzing the influence of authorship, the esteemed reputation of the artist prominently elevates the artwork's standing in comparison to lesser-known counterparts. The nature of the painting as an oil on canvas further supports its market value, as collector demand often favors such classic mediums. Additionally, the artwork's considerable dimensions render a more imposing presence, expanding its appeal in galleries and private collections alike.

Turning to age, while "Sunset Harmony" holds the allure of a historical piece, its vintage does not solely dictate its value. Instead, when contextualized within art market trends, its era of creation enhances its appeal among connoisseurs seeking nostalgia-infused investments.
