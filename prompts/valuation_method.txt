# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork:**
The Mark to Market valuation method, noted for reflecting current market conditions, plays a pivotal role in appraising this Impressionist masterpiece. The artist's established reputation in the international art market, evidenced by numerous museum exhibitions and strong auction results, significantly influences the valuation. The painting's impressive scale and masterful technique further enhance its market position, while its excellent condition and documented provenance contribute to its desirability among collectors. Additionally, the current strong demand for Impressionist works of this caliber supports a robust valuation.

Recent market analysis reveals a consistent upward trend in prices for comparable Impressionist paintings, particularly those with similar provenance and condition. The artwork's historical significance within the artist's oeuvre, combined with the growing appreciation for Impressionist works among both private collectors and institutions, suggests strong potential for value appreciation. These factors, alongside the painting's exceptional quality and the artist's enduring market presence, contribute to a valuation that reflects both current market dynamics and long-term investment potential.

**Example 2 - Antique:**
The Mark to Market approach proves essential in determining the current value of this Georgian mahogany secretary desk. The Chippendale workshop's enduring reputation for excellence, combined with the piece's exceptional craftsmanship and original condition, positions it prominently within the market for 18th-century English furniture. The presence of original hardware and documented provenance significantly enhances its market appeal, while the increasing rarity of comparable pieces from this period supports a premium valuation.

Analysis of recent auction results and dealer transactions reveals strong demand for high-quality Georgian furniture, particularly pieces with documented workshop attribution. The desk's superior construction quality, featuring hand-cut dovetails and period-appropriate joinery, aligns with the highest standards of the era. These characteristics, coupled with the growing appreciation for investment-grade antique furniture, suggest continued market strength. The piece's historical significance and the Chippendale workshop's prestigious reputation further reinforce its position as a prime example of Georgian cabinetmaking.

**Example 3 - Collectible:**
The Mark to Market methodology provides a precise framework for valuing this Tiffany Studios Dragonfly lamp. The brand's preeminent position in the decorative arts market, combined with the lamp's documented early production date and exceptional condition, establishes a strong foundation for valuation. The Dragonfly pattern's status as one of Tiffany's most sought-after designs, along with the presence of original components and period-appropriate patination, significantly influences its market position. The studio's reputation for innovative glasswork and superior craftsmanship continues to drive strong collector demand.

Current market analysis indicates robust pricing for premium Tiffany lighting, particularly examples featuring popular naturalistic themes and original finishes. The lamp's documented provenance and excellent state of preservation align with the highest standards sought by sophisticated collectors. Recent auction results demonstrate consistent appreciation for exceptional Tiffany pieces, while the increasing scarcity of prime examples suggests continued market strength. These factors, combined with the growing international collector base for American Art Nouveau decorative arts, support a valuation that reflects both current market dynamics and future appreciation potential.
